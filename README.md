# advent-of-code-2020

To run the problem for a day, run the Python module like

```sh
python -m problem01
```

Run the tests (yes I wrote tests) with `tox` or `pytest` or to run them for just
one problem, `pytest <directory>`.

Install the pre-commit hooks to keep the code nicely formatted via
[pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) with `pre-commit install`.
